# fxSwap
A foreign exchange swap or currency swap is a contract under which two parties agree to exchange two currencies at a set rate and then to re-exchange those currencies at an agreed upon rate at a fixed date in the future.  Therefore, an FX swap consists of two transactions:  a spot transaction and a forward transaction.
